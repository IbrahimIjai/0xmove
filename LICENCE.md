## Custom Non-Commercial Open Source License for 0xmove

**Copyright (c) 2025 [Your Name/Handle]. All rights reserved.**

### Preamble
This license governs the use of the 0xmove project (the "Software"), an open-source experimental DeFi-fiat hybrid protocol. The goal is to promote transparency, collaboration, and proof-of-work by making the source code publicly available for non-commercial purposes. However, to protect the original ideas, innovations, and intellectual property of the creator, commercial use, direct copying for profit, or exploitation that could undermine the project's experimental and community-driven nature is prohibited.

You are free to:
- View, study, and learn from the code.
- Use, modify, and build upon it for personal, educational, or non-commercial research purposes.
- Contribute improvements back to the project under the same terms.

You are **not** permitted to:
- Use the Software or any derivative works for commercial purposes, including but not limited to selling, licensing, or integrating into profit-generating products/services without explicit written permission from the copyright holder.
- Distribute, sublicense, or copy the Software (or substantial portions thereof) in a way that enables commercial exploitation.
- Claim the ideas or core innovations (e.g., bidirectional yield-bearing ramps with Paystack integration) as your own for commercial gain.
- Remove or alter any copyright notices, license terms, or attributions.

### Permissions and Conditions
1. **Grant of License**: Subject to the terms below, the copyright holder grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute the Software solely for non-commercial purposes. Any distribution must include this license and retain all copyright notices.

2. **Attribution**: Any use, modification, or distribution must credit the original author (e.g., "Based on 0xmove by [Your Name/Handle], licensed under Custom NC-OSL").

3. **ShareAlike (for Non-Commercial)**: If you modify the Software, your modifications must be distributed under the same non-commercial terms, with attribution.

4. **No Warranty**: The Software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind. The copyright holder is not liable for any damages arising from its use.

5. **Trademarks**: "0xmove" and related branding are trademarks of [Your Name/Handle]. You may not use them without permission.

### Enforcement and Protection
This license is designed to balance openness with protection of the creator's intellectual property. Violations (e.g., unauthorized commercial use) may result in termination of the license and pursuit of legal remedies. By using this Software, you agree to these terms.

For commercial inquiries or permissions, contact [your.email@example.com].

### Why This License?
- **Open-Source Spirit**: Allows free access to foster learning and collaboration, proving the creator's work publicly.
- **Protection**: Restricts commercial copying to safeguard ideas and code from exploitation, while still enabling non-profit innovation.

If you need a different license, consider standard options like MIT (more permissive) or consult a lawyer for customization. This is not legal advice.
